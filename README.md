# Armed for War
The Fortress of War data pack replaces the vanilla Nether Fortress with a completely redefined structure, featuring multiple stages of intense combat as players destroy objectives to progress deeper into the Fortress, acquiring improved and custom loot on the way to an epic boss fight.

## The Fortress
The updated Nether Fortress replaces the original, and as such appears in the same biomes and rarities. It consists of an outer perimeter of open-air bridges, which connect to a maze-like interior of guarded hallways, surrounding a central keep. Although large animated Fortress Gates bar the way from the Bridges to the Interior to the Keep, players can break walls and travel between these areas if desired, though critical Objectives will not spawn until appropriately progressed.

When a player approaches a Nether Fortress for the first time, a bossbar will appear representing the entire Fortress, and Objectives will be spawned throughout the Bridges. Although the Bridges are long and winding, you may need to break through terrain or other parts of the Fortress to reach all of the Objectives.

Once all Objectives on the Bridges have been destroyed, you'll be able to open the Fortress Gates to access the newly spawned Objectives within. When those are destroyed, the final Fortress Gate will open, revealing the Fortress Matrix.

While a Nether Fortess is active, Wither Skeletons that are spawned in it will have a chance to drop Wicked Apples, and have a chance to spawn equipped with full Wartorn gear.

## Fortress Objectives
These are unique animated entities that represent the integrity of the Fortress. They are stationary, and can be attacked and dealt damage like mobs, reducing the Fortress' bossbar. When destroyed, they drop appropriate loot.

There are four types of Objectives, each with different Health and behavior.

## The Fortress Matrix
The Fortress Matrix appears to be a man-made creature, like a golem. It has a central glowing core--the boss itself--and is surrounded by glowing bricks that it manipulates around itself for attack and defense.

When spawned, it will idle in the Central Keep. Once a player approaches it, it will come to life and begin to attack. If ever there are no players nearby, it will reset, fully restoring its health--it must be defeated in one attempt.

<details>
  <summary>Fortress Matrix Behavior</summary>

</details>

When the Fortress Matrix is killed, it drops an assortment of valuable loot, lots of XP, and one of the below Reward Items.

<details>
  <summary>Reward Items</summary>
 
**Blazing Sword**

</details>

After the Fortress Matrix is killed, the bossbar will vanish and the Nether Fortress will become inactive, no longer applying changes to mobs that spawn in it. At any time, a player can re-activate the Fortress by placing three End Crystals on the Bedrock blocks inside the Central Keep. This will teleport all players in the Central Keep outside of a random Fortress Gate, respawn all Bridge Objectives, and make the Nether Fortress active again.
